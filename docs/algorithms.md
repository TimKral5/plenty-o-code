## Sorting Algorithms

### Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort simply moves from index to index. It compares the value
of each position with the next value and if the current position is
larger, swaps the two positions. The run-throughs are repeated until
there are no swaps anymore.

### Selection Sort

Selection Sort iterates through the array and keeps track of the
lowest value. At the end of an iteration, the lowest value is moved
to the front of the array. This operation is then repeated with the
remaining values. This is done until there are no values left.

### Insertion Sort

Iteration Sort iterates through the values until it finds a value
that is not sorted correctly. The value is then compared to the
previous index and shifted back until its ordered correctly.
This process is then repeated from the last validated index until all
indeces are validated.

### Counting Sort

Counting Sort counts how many times each value occurs and then
constructs the resulting array in a given order.

### Radix Sort

Radix Sort sorts decimal numbers per digit. It starts at the least
significant digit and sorts the values into buckets that match the
digit (there might be another sorting algorithm at play for this).
Then, the numbers are reformed into an array, on which the same
process is repeated with the next digit.

### Merge Sort

Merge Sort divides the array into smaller and smaller sets until the
smallest sets only contain a single value each. The sets at the
deepest layers are then sorted. Then the algorithm moves to the
bigger layer and sorts again. This is repeated until the whole array
is sorted.

Linear search is pretty straight-forward as it simply iterates from
